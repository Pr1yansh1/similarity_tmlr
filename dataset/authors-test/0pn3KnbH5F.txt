Abstract
Learning-to-defer is a framework to automatically defer decision-making to a human expert
when ML-based decisions are deemed unreliable. Existing learning-to-defer frameworks are
not designed for sequential settings. That is, they defer at every instance independently,
based on immediate predictions, while ignoring the potential long-term impact of these
interventions. As a result, existing frameworks are myopic. Further, they do not defer
adaptively, which is crucial when human interventions are costly. In this work, we propose
Sequential Learning-to-Defer (SLTD), a framework for learning-to-defer to a domain expert
in sequential decision-making settings. Contrary to existing literature, we pose the problem
of learning-to-defer as model-based reinforcement learning (RL) to i) account for long-term
consequences of ML-based actions using RL and ii) adaptively defer based on the dynamics
(model-based). Our proposed framework determines whether to defer (at each time step) by
quantifying whether a deferral now will improve the value compared to delaying deferral to
the next time step. To quantify the improvement, we account for potential future deferrals.
As a result, we learn a pre-emptive deferral policy (i.e. a policy that defers early if using the
ML-based policy could worsen long-term outcomes). Our deferral policy is adaptive to the
non-stationarity in the dynamics. We demonstrate that adaptive deferral via SLTD provides
an improved trade-oﬀ between long-term outcomes and deferral frequency on synthetic,
semi-synthetic, and real-world data with non-stationary dynamics. Finally, we interpret
the deferral decision by decomposing the propagated (long-term) uncertainty around the
outcome, to justify the deferral decision.
1 Introduction
Machine learning (ML) has the potential to be deployed for decision-making in complex domains such as
healthcare, lending, and legal systems. In many cases, ML-based policy may not generalize to situations not
encountered during training. In practice, it may be safer to defer to a human expert when using the ML
policy may not improve outcomes or cause active harm. Automatically deferring to a human expert is called
‘Learning-to-defer.’ Earlier works have considered the problem of learning-to-defer in non-sequential settings
(Mozannar and Sontag, 2020; Madras et al., 2017)..
In situations such as managing health, however, two key challenges remain. First, deferral decisions can
signiﬁcantly alter long-term outcomes. Thus modeling the long-term outcome is critical to decide whento
defer to an expert. Deferring too late may lead to unintended and irreversible harm. Deferring too early
may increase the burden on the human expert. Second, when human interventions (after deferral) are costly,
learning-to-defer adaptively and only when critical is crucial. To defer adaptively, we need a well-characterized
model of the environment, a challenging estimation issue, especially under non-stationarity, i.e., when the
dynamics of the environment change over time.
Existing learning-to-defer methods defer based on immediate outcomes e.g. Mozannar and Sontag (2020);
Madras et al. (2017); Gennatas et al. (2020), and are therefore myopic. Further, the objective to defer is
to improve the performance of some prediction tasks (such as the ability to predict a patient outcome).
These frameworks either defer based on the probability of correct short-term prediction or characterizing
the trade-oﬀ of paying a cost (to defer). Instead, interventions based on an ML system can have long-term
consequences that are crucial to the model. Further, in many cases, merely deferring to optimize for decision/

prediction accuracy in a supervised learning setting does not suﬃce to improve long-term outcomes. Existing
approaches also do not leverage the potential of modeling the environment to defer adaptively , especially
beneﬁcial if the environment is non-stationary.

Figure 1: A conceptual overview of deferral strategies in a medical setting. We show potential patient
outcome trajectories over time (x-axis). The outcome is shown on the y-axis. A higher outcome is better.
A discretized reward is available to us: ‘Healthy’, ‘Continue Monitoring’, and ‘Adverse’. The white regions
indicate regions where πtarwill provide similar recommendations to π0(speciﬁc actions are not shown). The
shaded gray region indicates that at these times, the patient is in states (not shown) where πtarprovides
recommendations that do not improve long-term outcomes compared to π0. The patient follows the gray
trajectory from time t= 0tot= 2whenπtar’s recommendations are used. The red trajectory shows the
ﬁnal outcome if we continue to use πtartill the end of the horizon. One potential deferral strategy is to defer
when the observed outcome deteriorates to ‘Adverse’ (orange trajectory). This deferral is late/myopic and
the expert policy is unable to signiﬁcantly improve the patient’s outcome in a single time step. This baseline
is akin to a model where the expert takes over from πtarwhen they see that the patient is deteriorating and
is not an automated deferral. A better-automated deferral strategy is to defer when the predicted outcome
usingπtaris ‘Adverse’ (yellow trajectory). This deferral strategy corresponds to supervised learning-to-defer
methods such as those of Mozannar et. al. and Madras et. al. and is also late/myopic as i) it is based
on immediate predicted outcomes, and ii) does not characterize the regions of the state-space where πtar
is worse than π0(gray region) in terms of the long-term patient outcome. On the other hand, the green
trajectories indicate long-term outcomes if we defer in the gray region (corresponding to what SLTD and
SLTD-Stationary will do), where immediate predicted outcomes are not adverse, but long-term consequences
of continuing to use πtarsigniﬁcantly deteriorate the patient. Note that here we do not show the distinction
between behaviors due to the non-stationarity of the dynamics. Thus, ideally, a pre-emptive deferral policy
should characterize all regions of the state space where long-term outcomes using πtarare worse than π0,
and defer accordingly. Also note that here, both green trajectories are pre-emptive according to our setup
though SLTD will defer earlier at t= 3as well as at t= 4and then rely on πtarfort≥5. In regions marked
“Early defer”, we would like to avoid deferrals since as πtaris as good as or better than π0and deferring is
unnecessarily costly. SLTD can avoid such premature deferrals by incorporating a cost for deferrals.
Algorithmic Motivation. To address these challenges, we deviate signiﬁcantly from existing learning-
to-defer methods, which use a supervised learning framework. Instead, we model the learning-to-defer
problem for sequential settings as oﬄine model-based reinforcement learning (RL). SLTD is the ﬁrst RL-based
learning-to-defer framework. We focus on settings where online experimentation is prohibitive for safety
reasons, such as healthcare.
We assume access to batch data collected by human experts (such as clinicians) using a behavior policy. Our
goal is to learn a deferral policy with respect to a ﬁxed ML-based policy (called the target policy). SLTD
decides whether or not to defer (to an expert policy) at each instance by modeling the impact of delaying
deferral(by one time step) on the long-term outcomes. SLTD defers if delaying deferral does not improve
outcomes compared to deferring in the current instance. To quantify long-term outcomes, we also account for
all future deferrals. In doing so, SLTD precisely identiﬁes the regions of the state space where the target
ML-based policy will not improve outcomes. As a result, our method is pre-emptive, i.e., it defers in all
2Under review as submission to TMLR
regions where the ML policy is unlikely to improve long-term outcomes . See Figure 1 for a conceptual overview
of SLTD.
Human expert interventions are often costly. Hence deferring too often is not desirable. To defer adaptively ,
we propose to leverage an estimate of the environment dynamics and the associated uncertainty. Modeling
the dynamics allows us to reliably quantify the impact of delaying deferral on long-term outcomes, which is
particularly beneﬁcial in non-stationary settings. We show that modeling the non-stationarity provides a
better trade-oﬀ of improving outcomes versus the frequency of deferrals. In a myopic environment (i.e., when
the eﬀect of interventions are observed in the near future), it may seem unnecessary to model the dynamics.
However, we demonstrate that deferral methods that defer myopically, based on immediate outcomes still
beneﬁt from modeling the dynamics, and consequently the impact of potential future myopic deferrals. When
SLTD defers, human experts can beneﬁt from an additional justiﬁcation of the deferral decision to determine
potential interventions. Hence, we also interpret SLTD’s decision to defer at any given time by quantifying
the long-term uncertainty in the outcome and decomposing the sources of uncertainty. We justify how the
decomposition can guide experts to potential interventions.
Clinical Motivation. We are motivated by clinical settings where a target policy is learned from batch data
to work well across multiple institutions. Such a policy may perform well on average, but when deployed to a
new environment, encounter a diﬀerent or an evolving patient population. An evolving patient physiology
can often result in non-stationary dynamics on which the target policy is not uniformly better, necessitating
deferral. Clinicians might also follow a slightly diﬀerent treatment protocol than this learned policy, which
could be an auxiliary reason to defer. Most importantly, regulatory constraints may prevent signiﬁcantly
adapting our target policy completely to the new site. In this case, it is safer to leverage batch data from the
new site to quantify when it is reliable to deploy the learned target policy. In situations where the policy
does not improve outcomes compared to the human expert, exacerbated by challenges like non-stationarity, it
is safer to defer to human experts. We further propose a model-based method motivated by the fact that in
many clinical settings, mechanistic models of patient physiology are available. Beyond healthcare, our work
is applicable in many safety-focused, data-scarce, non-stationary settings where online policy improvement is
not allowed due to ethical or practical constraints.
2 Related Work & Background
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Many methods focus on deciding to deploy two or more policies. For
example, Jacobs et al. (1991); Jordan and Jacobs (1994) switch between diﬀerent policies in decision-making
by partitioning the input space into regions assigned to diﬀerent specialized sub-models. Variants of this
framework enforce an explicit preference for a speciﬁc expert, e.g., a human expert, and train other experts to
complement the human expert (Pradier et al., 2021). In sequential settings, Parbhoo et al. (2017); Gottesman
et al. (2019); Parbhoo et al. (2018) combine parametric and non-parametric experts to learn more accurate
estimates of the value function. On the other hand, we focus on deferral to human experts when future
outcomes using the current ML-based policy are potentially undesirable . Further, we defer based on explicitly
quantifying the impact of delayed deferral to decide whento defer.
Policy Improvement with Expert Supervision. Sonabend et al. (2020) use hypothesis testing to assess
whether, at each state, a policy from a human expert would improve value estimates over a target policy
during training to improve the target policy. In contrast, our work identiﬁes the value of delaying deferral to
a human expert at test time . Improvements using expert supervision are unlikely to be always feasible due
to safety and regulatory constraints. Learning-to-defer with respect to a ﬁxed target policy is crucial as a
safeguard. Some works focus on safe policy improvement in a non-stationary MDP setting (Chandak et al.,
2020b;a). Chandak et al. (2020a) assume that the non-stationarity is governed by an exogenous process, and
so past actions do not impact the underlying non-stationarity. Our work diﬀers in two ways: ﬁrst, we argue
that model misspeciﬁcation, speciﬁcally ignoring non-stationarity induced by (deferral) actions, aﬀects the
likelihood of future deferrals. Accounting for this non-stationarity is crucial to avoid costly deferrals. Second,
we incorporate human expertise by explicitly measuring the impact of delaying deferral.
Learning-to-defer to Human Expertise. Madras et al. (2017); Mozannar and Sontag (2020) propose
supervised models to defer to the expert. Here, the classiﬁers are trained on the samples of an expert’s
decisions. Madras et al. (2017) train a separate rejection and prediction function, while Mozannar and Sontag
3Under review as submission to TMLR
(2020) learn a joint predictor for all targets and deferral. Madras et al. (2017) is conceptually closer to our
work but in a non-sequential setting. Other approaches such as Raghu et al. (2019); Wilder et al. (2020)
ﬁrst train a standard classiﬁer on the data and then compute uncertainty estimates for this classiﬁer and the
human expert. The models defer to the expert if the model is highly uncertain or can signiﬁcantly beneﬁt
from deferral. Liu et al. (2021) incorporate uncertainty in Learning-to-Defer algorithms for classiﬁcation
tasks. Instead, we focus on learning-to-defer in non-stationary, sequential settings. Our work highlights the
role that the dynamics of the environment can have on our ability to defer preemptively.
Learning-to-defer as Causal OPPE. We pose our Learning-to-defer problem as an oﬄine model-based
reinforcement learning problem (OPPE). Besides learning, evaluating the utility of a policy (on data collected
from a behavior policy) in an oﬄine manner is called Oﬀ-policy Evaluation (OPE) (Precup, 2000). OPE is
a challenging problem as the utility of a policy needs to be determined without exploration. Literature on
OPE is extensive, summarized in a seminal review of (Uehara et al., 2022). Two major classes of solutions i)
Importance Sampling (IS), and ii) Q-learning are used for OPE tasks. Q-learning requires making parametric
assumptions of the Action-value functions. We strongly believe this is less grounded for healthcare settings.
On the other hand, mechanistic models of disease and physiology are often available in clinical settings,
motivating our model-based approach to oﬄine learning. For evaluating the quality of our proposed method,
we rely on either the knowledge of the true dynamics or IS in this work. IS is asymptotically unbiased but
can suﬀer from variance challenges in ﬁnite-sample settings. For real-world data, we use the self-normalized
variant of importance sampling from Uehara et al. (2022); Precup (2000); Robins et al. (2007) as one of the
evaluation metrics.
Implicit in the framework of OPE, including our work, are assumptions about no hidden confounding, which
are surfaced by a causal framing of the OPE problem (Uehara et al., 2022; Gottesman et al., 2018). This
view poses OPE as a causal inference problem given observations from a causal system. The no-hidden
confounding assumption is primarily because most OPE solutions assume that the data is generated from an
MDP which does not allow for potential latent factors to drive decisions. This assumption can have profound
consequences on the quality of OPE estimates. In our setup, we also assume that our oﬄine data is generated
from an MDP, thus making the no unobserved/hidden confounding assumption.
Eﬀorts to relax this assumption allow for the presence of latent factors that inﬂuence decision-making in
oﬀ-line data and provide OPE estimates that are robust to the variability of this inﬂuence (Kallus and
Zhou, 2018; Tennenholtz et al., 2020; Oberst and Sontag, 2019). Often these works focus on parametric
assumptions of how much the propensity or the probability of a particular treatment is allowed to deviate,
known as the Marginal Structural Model (MSM) assumption (Robins et al., 2000) to provide conservative
OPE estimates under worst-case deviations under the MSM assumption. The utility of MSM assumptions
has been signiﬁcant in epidemiological settings, though relevance in chronic condition management, which is
the focus of our clinical setting, is less clear.
Decomposing Uncertainty for Interpreting Policies. Uncertainty, if well calibrated can help decision-
makers understand the failure modes of a model (Bhatt et al., 2020; Tomsett et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020).
Several methods estimate predictive uncertainty in ML (Gal and Ghahramani, 2016; Guo et al., 2017). Here,
we focus on capturing the propagated uncertainty in sequential settings to interpret deferral decisions. We
interpret the (diﬀerent) sources of propagated uncertainty when SLTD defers to the expert. Decomposing
the sources of uncertainty into modeling and irreducible uncertainty over predictions has been explored
in classiﬁcation and prediction settings (Yao et al., 2019; Depeweg et al., 2018) but remains signiﬁcantly
under-explored for sequential settings.
Background and Notation. We consider our environment to be a ﬁnite horizon MDP deﬁned by
M≡ (S,A,P,r,p 0)whereSindicates the state-space, Aindicates the action-space, Pthe transition
dynamics,r:s×a→R+the reward function, p0the initial state distribution. The action-space is assumed
to be discrete, while the state space can be discrete or continuous. Any intervention policy (usually stochastic
in our case) is given by π=:S×A→ [0,1]. We consider a non-stationary environment such that the
dynamics at any time tare governed by a speciﬁc MDP Mt. Thus the environment is a sequence of MDPs.
We assume the existence of a true set of non-stationary dynamics governing all episodes and denote it by
M∗:={M∗

3 Sequential Learning-to-Defer
Problem Setup. Assume we are given a policy πtarthat may be learned from batch data from one or more
environments. πtaris intended to be deployed in a new environment. We have access to batch data, denoted
byD∗={si,0,ai,0,ri,0,···,si,T,ai,T,ri,T}N
i=1collected in the new non-stationary environment M∗={M∗
t}t,
from some (potentially non-stationary) expert policy π0. Note that we assume that π0is given. For example,
it may be the behavior policy from which we have data samples in the target environment. Here Ndenotes
the number of episodes. Our goal is to learn a deferral policy gπtar(s,t) :S×T→{0,1}(where 1corresponds
to defer or⊥) with respect to πtarto defer to the expert policy π0. In practice, experts may deviate from π0
in some cases. In our experiments, we account for this by using an /epsilon1-greedy version of the behavior policy
asπ0, which serves as a proxy model for such deviation. In addition, a clinician may override a treatment
recommendation even when a model does not defer. We account for this using /epsilon1-greedy version of πtar. For
ease of exposition, we still refer to them as π0andπtar.
Deferral to the expert is denoted by the action ⊥. That is, we will augment the action space of existing
MDPM∗to include a new deferral action A⊥:=A∪⊥. At every step, the agent decides whether or not
to defer. If the agent defers, π0will be deployed for that time step. We describe the formulation assuming
strict adherence to π0at deferral to emphasize other aspects of our contribution such as the impact of
non-stationarity and how to account for relevant sources of uncertainty to compare outcomes. SLTD can
easily account for the uncertainty of expert actions in the framework.
In practice, the target policy πtarmay not uniformly improve over π0for all states. That is guaranteeing that
VM∗
πtar,0(s)≥VM∗
π0,0(s)for alls∈S, is challenging. Even when ﬁne-tuning is allowed, it is challenging to ensure
that the target policy is indeed better than π0in all regions of the state space. Hence, we would like to get
the best of both worlds. We can deploy πtar, to reduce the costs of relying on human expertise, and learn
to automatically defer to the costlier policy π0(i.e. human expert) when relying on πtardoes not improve
outcomes. In regions of the state-space where the value of πtaris lower than π0, it is better to defer to the
human as a “safety protocol”. Formally, we only assume that Vπtar(s)>Vπ0(s)for some states s∈S.
Type of non-stationarity: Assuming that the non-stationary dynamics are represented by a sequence of MDPs
allows the SLTD framework to be general and not restricted to speciﬁc forms of non-stationary environments.
The main diﬀerence between each component in the MDP sequence is that they can be arbitrarily diﬀerent
state-transition dynamics within the same family of distributions (e.g. gaussian or multinomial distributions).
As a result, this sequence will not share the optimal policy, and hence the optimal is a non-stationary
deterministic policy. When mechanistic models on the speciﬁc typeof non-stationarity are available, they can
be incorporated into our framework to provide less conservative deferral policies.
SLTD. To determine whether to defer at each time step, we quantify whether deferring (relying on π0) or
not deferring (using πtar) at the current time step improves the long-term outcome. Long-term outcomes are
aﬀected by potential future deferrals. Thus comparing the consequences of deferring versus relying on the
ML policy at the current instance is equivalent to comparing the impact of deferring now versus delaying
deferral by one time step.
Future deferrals imply that some unknown mixture of πtarandπ0is used in the future. We denote such a
mixture policy as πmix. To minimize cumbersome notation, we denote a policy where πtaris deployed at
instancetandπmixin the future as: πtar(t),mix(t+). Similarly, if we defer now, then the policy that is deployed
at timetisπ0, andπmixin the future. We denote this mixture as π0(t),mix(t+). Thus, at any instance t, we
want to defer if VM
πtar(t),mix(t+)(s)<VM
π0(t),mix(t+)(s). Note that we consider deferral to π0as a costly one. This
is accounted through a constant cost c >0in terms of the value. That is, deferral incurs cost cand the
resulting value is: VM
π0(t),mix(t+)(s)−c. We can now formalize our stochastic deferral policy:

π0(t),mix (t+)(s)−c)>τ],1[˜gπtar(s,t)>τ].
Corollary 1. By Deﬁnition 1, gπtar(s,t), includes the earliest time in the episode where ˜gπtar(s,t),
P(VM
πtar(t),mix(t+)<VM
π0(t),mix(t+)−c)>τ. Thus,gπtar(s,t)is a pre-emptive deferral policy.
The costcdetermines how conservative SLTD is and trades-oﬀ frequency of deferral to the value attained.This
parameter should be tuned by domain experts aware of the trade-oﬀ and risks involved. For instance, in a
critical care setting, we may be more conservative and use a smaller cthan in a chronic care situation. τis a
safety threshold on the probability of worse outcome beyond which we deem that deferral is necessary.
Deﬁnition 1 indicates that to reliably learn the deferral policy, we need to estimate ˜gπtar(s,t),
P(VM
πtar(t),mix (t+)(s)< VM
π0(t),mix (t+)(s)−c). To estimate this probability, we should model all sources of
uncertainty in the system, including the non-stationary dynamics, and the uncertainty associated with our
modeling assumptions. We use a Bayesian RL approach to account for all sources of uncertainty. We motivate
this by ﬁrst describing our dynamic programming approach to learn-to-defer.
Our dynamic programming procedure maintains an estimate of the deferral probability ˜gπtar(s,t)and reﬁnes
it as we train on the batch data. Given an estimate of ˜gπtar(s,t), we outline the procedure to i) estimate the
value under mixture policies corresponding to deferral (and delayed deferral), ii) modeling the probability of
improvement under various sources of uncertainty, and ﬁnally iii) obtaining a new estimate of the deferral
probability ˜gπtar(s,t)∀s∈Sat the given time tusing i) and ii). We then bootstrap this procedure over our
batch data to reﬁne our deferral probabilities. We describe the procedure for estimating the dynamics in the
discrete setting.

Estimating the probability of improving outcomes by delaying deferral. At each instance t, for
all statess, we can estimate the indicator function 1[VM∗
πtar(t),mix(t+)(s)<VM∗
π0(t),mix(t+)(s)−c]given an estimate
of˜gπtaras described above. However, we do not have access to the true dynamics M∗. In batch settings, such
as ours, we often estimate the dynamics using maximum-likelihood estimation. Such methods make speciﬁc
assumptions about the distribution governing the dynamics. Our assumptions about the dynamics may be
incorrect resulting in potential misspeciﬁcation of our dynamics model. This increases the uncertainty in the
outcome and potentially over-estimates the probability that relying on the model may improve outcomes. To
account for this additional source of uncertainty, we use a Bayesian RL approach. We describe the procedure
for the dynamics. The procedure for rewards follows an analogous process.
Suppose the parameters of the distributions governing the dynamics are denoted by θt∀t∈{0,···,T}. We
denote the full set of parameters by θ={θt}t. We assume a prior distribution over the parameters of the
distribution governing the dynamics PM
θ(s/prime|s,a)and the rewards r(s,a). Given batch samples D∗, we can
estimate the posterior distribution over the non-stationary MDPs and rewards using Bayesian inference:
p(θ|D∗)∝p(D∗|θ)p(θ)
More speciﬁcally, we assume conjugate priors for our parameters θ. By relying on conjugate priors in our
inference, the parameters of posterior distributions over the dynamics and rewards are obtained in closed
form. For discrete state dynamics (and rewards), we assume a Dirichlet prior distribution and model the
observations p(D∗|θ)using a Multinomial distribution. For continuous states, p(D∗|θ)is assumed to be
normally distributed with θbeing the mean and variance parameters. The prior distributions over the mean
and precision (inverse of the variance) is the Normal-gamma prior. This is a domain-dependent choice and
SLTD is agnostic so long as we can sample from the posterior distributions of the learned model dynamics. A
detailed derivation of how the data is leveraged to estimate the posterior distributions over the dynamics are
provided in Appendix A.1. By allowing ﬂexibility of modeling the dynamics via Bayesian RL, we can account
for uncertainty over our modeling assumptions.
Finally, based on our assumption that the non-stationary environment is governed by a sequence of MDPs,
we estimate the MDP for each time step independently from batch data. This allows us to make fewer
assumptions about the typeof non-stationarity. Any additional domain knowledge about the nature of
non-stationarity can be leveraged for data eﬃciency. We can now estimate the impact of delayed deferral by
sampling non-stationary MDPs from our posterior distributions and averaging to obtain our ﬁnal probability:

πtar(t),mix(t+)(s)<VM∗
π0(t),mix(t+)(s)−c)

where the second line comes from the deﬁnition due to the randomness over the dynamics, and the last
term comes from approximating the expectation using Ksamples from the posterior distribution of the
dynamicsp(·|D∗). Thus, for every instant t, in a given state s, our deferral policy gπtar(s,t)is given by,
gπtar(s,t) :=1[˜gπtar(s,t)>τ].
Dynamic Programming to estimate gπtar(s,t).Our dynamic programming procedure is summarized
in Algorithm 1. We initialize gπtar(s,t) = 0for alls∈S. We estimate VM
πtar(t),mix(t+)(s),VM
π0(t),mix(t+)(s)for a
giventusing Bellman Equations 1 and 2. Following that, we can update our estimate of gπtar(s,t)using our
posterior MDPs, i.e. Equation 3. We repeat (over t) using the updatedestimates of gπtar(s,t). Note further
thatπ0is stochastic. Thus, we do not make explicit assumptions on the speciﬁc actions an expert will take
in the futher. More speciﬁcally, SLTD accounts for the added uncertainty in human’s actions by explicitly
taking expectations over actions a∼π0. In our experiments, we use an /epsilon1-greedy versions of both π0andπtar,
which will allow for further deviations from the expert policy or allowing for overrides, to reﬂect realistic
settings.
Optimality of Learned Deferral Policy. Note that the optimal policy in our environment is a deter-
ministic non-stationary policy. More speciﬁcally, the optimal policy is a sequence of policies where each
7Under review as submission to TMLR
component in the sequence is optimal with respect to the speciﬁc dynamics at the corresponding time instance.
It may not be possible to always reach such an optimal via deferral. Our goal is thus to signiﬁcantly improve
over our target policy πtarby deferring to the expert policy. This could be envisioned as a setup where are
restricted to a policy class of oﬄine RL where we are only allowed to learn from families that defer to the
expert policy and use πtarotherwise.
4 Decomposing the uncertainty at deferral
SLTD defers at time tbecause the probability that relying on πtarimproves the outcome is below our safety
threshold, i.e. SLTD is uncertain of an improved outcome. Conveying this uncertainty can help the domain
expert take over decision-making. We interpret this deferral decision in terms of the total and decomposed
uncertainty on long-term outcomes. We convey two diﬀerent sources of uncertainty at deferral. First, we
consider epistemic/modeling uncertainty , which captures whether our model speciﬁcation has resulted in high
uncertainty and the aleatoric uncertainty which mainly results from the stochasticity of the environment
itself. A high relative value of the former suggests that adding more data to train SLTD can improve the
conﬁdence of the model. High aleatoric uncertainty suggests that the environment itself is highly variable
leading to the lack of conﬁdence in relying on πtar.
Concretely, let tdbe a time when SLTD defers. The agent is in state std. We are interested in the reward
(and uncertainty over the reward) at time Tdue to deferral at td, i.e., E[rT|std,µtd,π0(td),mix (td+)]. We
denote the posterior MDP samples for any state-action pair by µt. The variability in these samples captures
modeling uncertainty. The dynamics parameters are denoted by θt(s,a)for each state-action pair. First,
we sample the parameters of the dynamics from posterior distribution p(θt/prime|D∗), followed by sampling the
MDPsµt/prime∼p(µt/prime|θ/prime
t(st/prime,at/prime)). Once we defer, we sample actions from π0at timet/prime=tdandπmixfort/prime>td
where the mixture probability is determined by the learned gπtarfor future deferrals. The expected long-term
outcome is given by:
E[rT|std,µtd] =/integraldisplaysT
std+1/integraldisplayaT
atd/integraldisplayµT
µtd+1/integraldisplayT
θtdr(sT,aT)×T/productdisplay
t/prime=td+1pt/prime(st/prime|µt/prime)pt/prime(µt/prime|θ/prime
t(st/prime,at/prime))πt/prime(at/prime|st/prime)pt/prime(θt/prime|D)dsdadµdθ
Integrands are written in short-hand: s={std+1,std+2,···,sT}(analogously for other quantities). We
maintain one estimate of parameter θt/primeand sample KMDPsµt/primefrom this distribution. Thus, the epistemic
uncertainty we capture is due to the uncertainty over dynamics under ﬁxed parameters. The total uncertainty
can now be decomposed using the law of total variance:
Var(rT|std,D)/bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright
Total Uncertainty=Eµtd∼p(µtd|D)[Var(rT|µtd,std,D)]
/bracehtipupleft /bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft /bracehtipupright
Irreducible/ Aleatoric Uncertainty+Varµtd∼p(µtd|D)(E[rT|µtd,std,D])
/bracehtipupleft /bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft /bracehtipupright
Epistemic/Modeling Uncertainty
The second term is the variance conditioned on knowledge of the model µtd. This is the propagated uncertainty
due to modeling uncertainty at tdand can be reduced by data collection. The ﬁrst term averages over the
variance due to µtdand captures propagated uncertainty due to aleatoric uncertainty at td, which conveys
stochasticity of the environment itself. This uncertainty can only be reduced by careful interventions at td. We
estimate these using Monte-Carlo sampling. Additional details on the derivation are provided in Appendix A.2.
As suggested before, a high propagated epistemic uncertainty conveys that the current uncertainty of model
prediction (of the dynamics) is high but could be improved if additional data could be collected. High
propagated aleatoric uncertainty indicates high variability in the dynamics that can only be reduced with
careful interventions and is otherwise not manageable.
5 Experiments
We evaluate SLTD’s ability to defer adaptively in sequential settings with respect to a known and ﬁxed πtarto
the expert policy π0. We test the utility of i) deferring based on long-term outcomes, ii) adaptively deferring
by quantifying the impact of delaying deferral, i.e., in regions where delayed deferral can worsen outcomes,
iii) modeling the non-stationarity on deferral frequency, iv) quantifying multiple sources of uncertainty to
estimate the probability of diﬀerent outcomes under delayed deferral. We test our method on synthetic data,
a non-stationary diabetes simulator1modiﬁed from Chandak et al. (2020b), and real-world HIV data.

Synthetic Data. In this synthetic simulation, the region of deferral is known apriori by careful design of
πtar. This environment has 8discrete states and binary actions {a0,a1}. All samples start at state 0and
progress toward a sink state 7. The episode length is 15. State 6has a low reward ( −5) while all other states
have a reward of +1. The initial dynamics are set up such that action a0reduces the probability of landing
in stage 6, and action a1increases the probability of reaching state 6.πtarincreases the chances to reach
state 6unfavourably by taking action a1in states 2,3,4whent<5ort>12. We expect to defer in states
2,3,4even though rewards are favorable if a method is pre-emptive. When 5≤t≤12, the dynamics ﬂip such
thata0becomes an unfavorable action that increases the probability of landing in 6, whilea1reduces this
probability. Here, πtaragain increases the chances of landing in 6, by taking a0more often in states 2,3,4.
By ﬂipping the better action to a0in this region, it becomes crucial to estimate the dynamics over predicting
the best action. The dynamics are non-stationary and the probability of landing in state 6progressively
increases when 5≤t≤12. Fort≥13, the dynamics reset to noise levels at t<5adding non-stationarity to
the dynamics. Note that the optimal policy is π(s,t) = 1∀s∈S,5≤t≤12and0otherwise. The expert
policy is such that:
π0(s,t) :=p(a1) =

0.9if5≤t≤12,s∈{2,3,4}
0.7if5≤t≤12,s /∈{2,3,4}
0.1t<5ort>12,∀s∈S
for all states s∈S. In this case, pre-emptive deferral will allow us to reach close to the optimal by deferring
in states{2,3,4}.
Real-world simulator: Diabetes Data. We use an open-source implementation of the FDA-approved
Type-1 Diabetes Mellitus simulator (T1DMS) for modeling the treatment of Type-1 diabetes. We sample
10adolescent patient trajectories (episodes) over 24hours (aggregated at 15minute intervals). Glucose
levels are discretized into 13states. Combination interventions of insulin and bolus are discretized to
generate a total of 25actions. We introduce non-stationarity in each episode by increasingly changing the
adolescent patient’s properties to an alternative patient. We enable this by smoothly varying the weighting
of the patient parameters over the horizon. While this does not reﬂect a realistic patient scenario but will
nonetheless evaluate the utility of all methods for a smoothly transitioning non-stationary environment. The
non-stationarity signiﬁcantly aﬀects the utility of the initial target policy which is learned on the dynamics of
the original patient, thus necessitating deferral as the patient properties change over time. The non-stationary
target policy πtarfor this task is estimated using Q-learning. An /epsilon1-greedy version of this Q-learned policy
is used in our experiments. We defer to a clinician policy, here simulated by learning an /epsilon1-greedy version
of a policy learned using Q-learning under (estimated) non-stationary dynamics on the target data. For
evaluation of value post learning, we estimate the dynamics on N= 1000patients to remove estimation bias
for evaluation purposes. We further provide IS estimates as we discuss in the metrics below.
Real-world: HIV Data. We identiﬁed individuals between 18-72 years of age from the EuResist database
(Zazzi et al., 2012) comprising of genotype, phenotype, and clinical information of over 65,000 individuals in
response to antiretroviral therapy administered between 1983-2018. We focus on a subset of 32,960patients’
genotype, treatment response, CD 4+, and viral load measurements, gender, age, risk group, number of past
treatments collected over on average 14years (aggregated at 4-6 month intervals). Our action space consists
of the 25most frequently occurring drug combinations, while our state space consists of 100continuous
states of cell counts and viral loads. Since the virus evolves in response to drug pressure, the problem is
inherently non-stationary. Our data is collected using a standard ﬁrst-line therapy provided by clinicians.
For our ﬁrst case study (Case-I), we use a candidate clinician-provided policy as πtar. Given data from the
ﬁrst-line therapy, we investigate whether deferring to second-line therapy ( π0), as proposed by standard
medical guidelines in response to potential drug resistance(Saag et al., 2020), improves long-term outcomes.
The non-stationary behavior policy is the ﬁrst line therapy estimated using Q-learning. For our second case
study (Case-II), data is collected from a non-stationary behavior policy which corresponds to a ﬁrst-line
therapy typically used for treating patients of subtype C. Using the same candidate πtaras in Case I, we then
examine whether deferring to ﬁrst-line therapy, given by clinical collaborators, for patients of subtype M (due
to potential drug resistance) improves long-term outcomes.

Figure 2: Learned deferral probabilities for SLTD (top row), SLTD stationary (second row), SLTD one-step (third row),
and Augmented-MDP (red dotted line) for c= 0. Each row is a method (Row 1 is SLTD, Row 2 is SLTD-Stationary,
and Row 3 is SLTD-One Step). We are plotting ˜gπtar(s,t)which is a function of states sand timet. Since this is
a function of two dimensions, we represent the variation along tin a row and then for each ﬁxed t, we show the
diﬀerent values this function can take for diﬀerent states s. According to Synthetic data design, target policy always
takes suboptimal actions in the yellow region. That is, the optimal deferral policy is to defer for all states 2,3,4for
all0≤t≤15. That is,gπtar(s,t) = 1∀s∈{2,3,4}and0≤t≤15and0otherwise. Further, the dynamics change
over time so that the optimal action ﬂips, as well as the noise increases when 5≤t≤12requires deferral more
often. Thus, shaded yellow regions are the region of pre-emptive deferral. SLTD, which models non-stationarity defers
adaptively and early in the shaded yellow region (top row) and increases the deferral probability when dynamics
change. SLTD-stationary does not learn calibrated probabilities in the yellow region over time and only defers when
theaveragedynamics of the environment require deferral. SLTD-one-step and Augmented-MDP (dotted red line) only
defer in state 6when the reward is negative and is not pre-emptive.
Mozannar et. al. (Mozannar and Sontag, 2020): This is a supervised method using a consistent loss
function to learn-to-defer. It learns an augmented regressor to defer or recommend treatment myopically
(independently at every time step). When the model defers, the clinician’s treatment recommendation is
used.
Madras et. al. (Madras et al., 2017): This is an alternative supervised learning-to-defer method. This
baseline learns separate regressors to defer and recommend treatments. We modify it to use πtarto recommend
and learn the rejection function to defer to π0. Note that both the supervised learning-to-defer methods are
trained to predict action targets.
Augmented-MDP : A conceptual contribution of SLTD is to defer by comparing outcomes by delaying
deferral with some knowledge of the expert policy. The deferral action itself is considered to augment the
MDP action space. We explore a baseline that uses Value Iteration in this augmented MDP. Comparing with
this baseline helps evaluate the utility of deferring based on outcomes of delayed versus immediate deferral.
This baseline will defer permanently to the expert, and knowledge of an expert policy is not assumed. This
augmented MDP has action-space is A∪⊥, an augmented state-space S∪sdefer(sdeferis the deferred state),
and defers based on the cost c. This baseline models non-stationary dynamics, and is designed for sequential
settings. However since this method defers permanently to the expert, it incurs a larger deferral cost. In our
experiments, all values are plotted withoutthe cost to reﬂect actual environment outcomes.
SLTD-Stationary : To assess the impact of misspecifying the non-stationarity, we compare to a variant of
SLTD that assumes the dynamics (and rewards) are stationary while allowing the method the ﬂexibility of
learning a non-stationary deferral policy.
SLTD-One Step : We compare to a myopic version of SLTD that defers based on the immediate reward.
The key diﬀerence with the myopic Madras et. al., Mozannar et. al. baselines is that SLTD-One Step models
the dynamics and the uncertainty on the immediate reward. Thus, this baseline accounts for future deferrals
while deferring myopically.
Ablations for Uncertainty Modeling : For all SLTD variants, we evaluate the utility of accounting for
diﬀerent sources of uncertainty, more speciﬁcally the modeling uncertainty to estimate the probability of
improving outcomes via delayed deferral. In SLTD, modeling uncertainty is accounted for by sampling
multiple (K) MDPs (Equation 3) from the posterior dynamics distribution, over which our outcomes are
averaged. Higher variability across Kindicates higher modeling uncertainty. Hence, in Equation 3, using
10Under review as submission to TMLR
K= 1assumes a perfect estimate of the dynamics model and only accounts for the irreducible stochasticity
of the environment. A larger Kaccounts for potential variability in estimation (original SLTD formulation).
If our modeling uncertainty in the environment is indeed large, we anticipate the choice of Kto have a larger
eﬀect on SLTD’s performance. Modeling uncertainty can be large when there is insuﬃcient data to ﬁt the
target function class of the dynamics.

estimates.
5.1 Evaluation Metrics.
We use the following evaluation metrics for assessing our proposed models.
Value Estimation. Once a deferral policy is learned, evaluating its utility using oﬄine data is the problem
of oﬀ-policy evaluation (OPE). We use the following estimation procedure for evaluating the Value of a
deferral policy:
1.Rollout with true dynamics: For Synthetic data and Diabetes , we have access to the true dynamics ,
although Diabetes data may be prone to discretization error. Here we can roll out the trajectories
under the true dynamics using deferral and collect the true value estimates. In our experiments, we
collect 10000trajectories for all datasets. We use two variants of the deferral policy learned by each
method: i) Thresholded deterministic policy, as proposed in our setup, and ii) Stochastic version
of the learned deferral policy. The latter allows for better comparison with our third method for
estimating the value, speciﬁcally Importance Sampling.
2.Rollout with estimated dynamics: For HIV data, we do not have access to the true dynamics.
Hence we use the same procedure above but with estimated dynamics, which are estimated using
Maximum-Likelihood. This evaluation can be used when there is suﬃcient domain knowledge to rely
on the utility of MLE estimates of dynamics. In our HIV data, the MLE estimates are considered
state-of-the-art in clinical knowledge of HIV treatment Parbhoo et al. (2017). However, in general,
relying on an MLE estimate is prone to a biased value estimate.
3.Self-normalized Importance Sampling (IS): For real-world data where true dynamics are unavailable
and relying on MLE estimates of the dynamics may lead to bias, we provide an IS estimate of the
11Under review as submission to TMLR
value. This metric will likely be used in most real-world scenarios while choosing the best deferral
policy. Note that IS is only asymptotically unbiased and suﬀers from large variance issues. Hence
we use a Self-normalized IS estimate. Further, IS can only be used when the assumption of no
unobserved confounding holds. In cases where true dynamics are known, such as Synthetic data,
comparing the value estimate from the rollout of the stochastic version of the deferral policy (under
true dynamics) and the Self-normalized IS version can provide a good sense of the amount of bias
in the IS estimate. In our results, we provide IS estimates for stochastic versions of SLTD and its
variants for nuanced comparison.
Deferral Frequency. In order to assess the trade-oﬀ of deferral frequency and value attained, we use the
true dynamics for Synthetic data and Diabetes data to roll out trajectories and estimate deferral frequency.
For HIV data, we use the Maximum-Likelihood dynamics to roll out trajectories to estimate deferral frequency
based on the consistency of value estimates of Self-normalized IS and MLE dynamics, which then allows us
to use the MLE dynamics to roll out trajectories. Please see further justiﬁcation of this choice in Section 6.

stochastic deferral policy, i.e. sampling to defer (second column), iii) Self-normalized Importance Sampling

and hence stochastic vs threshold diﬀerence is not applicable. These baselines that defer stochastically and
hence appear in the ‘Stochastic defer’ column. Also note that Augmented-MDP is a deterministic policy.
For Synthetic data, IS estimate is biased relative to the True dynamics that uses a stochastic deferral policy,
suggesting IS estimates may not be reliable due to ﬁnite samples. For Diabetes , we see that IS is unable to
distinguish between diﬀerent deferral policies due to support diﬀerences between the target policy and the
behavior policy. We thus rely on values estimated from the true dynamics for our analysis.
6 Results
Optimizing for long-term outcomes learns qualitatively diﬀerent deferral policies. Our deferral
policy is a non-stationary stochastic function ˜gπtar(s,t)which we threshold. Visualizing ˜gπtar(s,t)enables us
to understand the utility of various modeling choices of SLTD. Figure 2 shows the histograms of ˜gπtarfor
SLTD and its Stationary and One-Step variant when the cost c= 0for Synthetic data. Visualizing without
deferral cost allows us to see how adaptive SLTD is without a penalty. Each row corresponds to a method;
the x-axis corresponds to time over the horizon T. Each box in a row corresponds to a single time point. For
a ﬁxedt,˜gπtaris a stochastic function of the states, shown as a histogram.

The yellow shaded region indicates the state space where πtartakes unfavorable actions. Over time, the
dynamics change so that the favorable action ﬂips 5≤t≤12and the stochasticity in the dynamics
increases requiring more frequent deferrals. Deferring in the yellow region is desirable to pre-emptively avoid
landing in a state of 6. SLTD is highly adaptive, and pre-emptively defers in the yellow region. As the
stochasticity increases, the probability of deferrals appropriately increases. The stationary variant signiﬁcantly
underestimates the need to defer in states 2,3,4whent<5. It is only able to pre-emptively defer in regions
where the average stochasticity of the estimated dynamics aligns with the environment. The One-Step variant
defers only in state 6and is therefore not preemptive. Augmented-MDP (red vertical line) deterministically
defers in state 6. Thus deferring based on the probability of improved outcomes of immediate and delayed
deferrals is desirable over alternatives (see also Figures 4, 5, and 6 in Appendix for Diabetes and HIV
data).
It is important to note that SLTD lowers deferral frequency for t≥12. The reason for this is twofold. First,
it is an artifact of the synthetic data that we use to evaluate SLTD. More speciﬁcally, there is an additional
form of non-stationarity that kicks in at t≥12where we stop adding noise to our dynamics, which resets
the dynamics to where they were at t<5. As a result, the deferral frequency is expected to be lower than
at5≤t≤12. Second, since SLTD is designed in an oﬄine learning environment, the support of the data
matters (for any oﬄine learning algorithm). For t>12, the oﬄine data collected does not have signiﬁcant
support over the “deferral” states [2,3,4], which induces an estimation issue. While we expect this to be
compensated by uncertainty modeling that we incorporate, lack of data support is a much more fundamental
problem in oﬄine learning, and we anticipate requiring better prior knowledge of the dynamics to completely
overcome the bias that is introduced in the deferral frequency. This bias further lowers deferral frequencies
even more compared to t<5. Nonetheless, the learned deferral policy reaches optimal as can be seen from
Table 9 and noting that the value estimate we have from the optimal policy for Synthetic data was estimated
to be≈7.9.

Figure 3: The trade-oﬀ of deferral frequency and value attained (Synthetic data and Diabetes use true
dynamics, while HIV uses Maximum-Likelihood estimates for value estimates). The plot shows the expected
value (higher is better) for a sweep over deferral cost (and any other method-speciﬁc hyperparameters) to
the deferral frequency (lower is better). SLTD achieves the best trade-oﬀ and better value by deferring
pre-emptively. The stationary variant defers signiﬁcantly more to achieve better outcomes. The One-Step
variant cannot improve over πtarin MDPs where the eﬀect of interventions is not myopic (Synthetic and HIV)
and achieve good performance by modeling the dynamics in Diabetes, compared to existing learning-to-defer
baselines Mozannar et. al. and Madras et. al. (which are myopic). Augmented-MDP is unable to achieve
good performance even at up to 50% deferral and unable to improve value in Diabetes indicating the beneﬁts
of deferring by explicitly quantifying the impact of delaying deferral as in SLTD over Augmented-MDP’s
Value Iteration method.
SLTD improves long-term outcomes. Tables 1 and 2 show the value (higher is better) for all baselines
using the diﬀerent value estimation methods outlined above. We have shown the highest value for each value
estimate independently. For HIV data, we do not see signiﬁcant diﬀerences between MLE dynamics and IS
evaluation metrics. SLTD unanimously outperforms all baselines. Table 2 shows signiﬁcant biases in the IS
estimate compared to the true dynamics suggesting it is not reliable for Synthetic data and Diabetes data.
Our original formulation of thresholding the deferral policy works better under the true dynamics than the
stochastic version as evidenced by results corresponding to the Stochastic defer variant. We nonetheless
13Under review as submission to TMLR
include this method to assess biases in IS estimates, as IS uses the stochastic deferral policy for value
estimation. Based on IS estimates, Augmented-MDP performs the best for Synthetic data. Table 10 in
Appendix shows the frequency of deferrals and the corresponding cost hyperparameter, if IS value estimates
are used to select the best deferral methods. This performance is obtained when there is no cost to deferring
(c= 0). Forc>0, we see a drop in value to 3.57±0.029for Augmented-MDP, with about 50%deferral
frequency. This suggests that SLTD is still eﬃcient and able to reach a high value for fewer deferrals in
Synthetic data data. Nonetheless, we would like to highlight that for Synthetic data we the IS estimates
appear to have a large bias to be entirely reliable.
For Diabetes data, support diﬀerences between the behavior and target policy result in unreliable IS estimates.
This is also evidenced by the fact that the clinician policy’s IS estimate is ≈−8.0, which is not possible
since the behavior policy is learned on the target data using Q-learning (the average value estimate from
Q-learning on the true dynamics was found to be 18.027). For the rest of this analysis, we thus focus on the
value estimates from the true dynamics for Synthetic data and Diabetes data, and we rely on the consistency
of all value evaluation methods for HIV to draw our conclusions.
Based on the true dynamics (and threshold policy), Augmented-MDP baseline is not preemptive despite
modeling the non-stationary dynamics. Hence, deferring by comparing outcomes of delayed deferral is a better
alternative, speciﬁcally Value Iteration on the Augmented MDP. Additional beneﬁts of modeling the dynamics
are clear from the improved performance of all SLTD variants compared to the myopic baselines.
Mis-speciﬁcation of dynamics (SLTD-Stat.) results in worse performance. SLTD-Stat. defers more often to
achieve comparable performance. Figure 3 demonstrates this trade-oﬀ is general, for all choices of deferral
costs and other parameters. In Figure 3, the x-axis corresponds to deferral frequency (lower is better) and
y-axis the value attained (higher is better). For Synthetic data and Diabetes , value estimates using the true
dynamics are shown. For HIV data, since we do not have access to the true dynamics, the deferral frequency
is estimated using an MLE estimate of the dynamics. From Table 1, we can see that all value estimates are
comparable. SLTD achieves the best trade-oﬀ.
Further, pre-emptive deferral allows SLTD to reach close to optimal (value average obtained is ≈7.9).
SLTD-One Step only relies on immediate rewards failing to improve long-term outcomes for synthetic data
and HIV. However, as long as we model the dynamics appropriately, even myopic deferral using SLTD One
Step is beneﬁcial for Diabetes compared to Mozannar et. al., Madras et. al.. This is possible when the eﬀect
of interventions is observed myopically, as is the case in Diabetes data since modeling the dynamics and
impact of future deferral is beneﬁcial to characterize. Madras et. al., Mozannar et. al. baselines are unable
to maximize long-term rewards. Madras et. al. performs well on Diabetes data suggesting optimal actions
don’t signiﬁcantly deviate in target data and that its design of training a rejection function worked better
than the loss function design of Mozannar et. al.

cases whereas in comparison, total variance is high. This indicates irreducible stochasticity of the dynamics is
the primary source of uncertainty. Additional results are in Appendix.
Ablations for uncertainty modeling. We study the utility of accounting for modeling uncertainty in
our framework. As described in Section 4, multiple sources of propagated uncertainty contribute to variability
in estimated outcomes. Modeling uncertainty is crucial to account for in a model-based framework. Here we
evaluate the impact of not accounting for this uncertainty on SLTD’s performance.
If modeling uncertainty is high, variability of the sampled MDPs used to estimate Equation 3 will be higher.
Evaluating for K= 1, will evaluate the impact of ignoring this uncertainty. In Table 9 (see also Figure 8
in Appendix), we demonstrate the results with K= 1for all SLTD variants. We do not observe signiﬁcant
diﬀerences for Synthetic data and Diabetes indicating that our modeling uncertainty is low in these data.

The diﬀerence is higher in HIV suggesting the importance of accounting for this uncertainty for real-world
HIV data. Such analysis is crucial to understanding whether our modeling assumptions are reasonable.
Decomposing uncertainty in SLTD can help interpret deferral. Conveying the type of uncertainty
to a domain expert can help identify the dominant source of uncertainty that resulted in a deferral to their
standard practice (expert policy). Table 3 shows this decomposition for one timepoint for discrete data. In
each case, the modeling uncertainty is a small fraction of the total uncertainty. This suggests that systematic
non-stationarity is the dominant source of uncertainty which generally cannot be reduced by collecting
data and may require careful interventions beyond the standard policy. Knowledge of the amount of model
uncertainty can enable users to further improve decision-making through data collection or improving model
assumptions.
7 Discussion
We proposed SLTD, a learning-to-defer framework for sequential settings using oﬄine model-based RL. We
learn a deferral policy by quantifying the impact of delaying deferral to the future. SLTD can defer based
on long-term outcomes and learns a pre-emptive deferral policy. Further, we emphasize a model-based
RL method that captures the dynamics of the environment, particularly non-stationarity. Modeling the
non-stationarity of the environment allows deferring adaptively. Misspecifying non-stationarity leads to
signiﬁcantly more deferrals to improve long-term outcomes. We demonstrate that existing learning-to-defer
frameworks are myopic. That is, these methods do not learn a pre-emptive policy even in sequential settings
as they focus on the immediate consequences of actions. We further demonstrate the utility of accounting for
all potential sources of stochasticity to quantify the impact of delayed deferral. Explicit characterization of the
probability of improving outcomes is beneﬁcial to prevent over-estimation of the beneﬁts of delaying deferral.
We further interpret deferral decisions of SLTD by decomposing the long-term propagated uncertainty.
Limitations and Future Work. While quantifying the uncertainty is useful, especially to compensate for
the fundamental challenge of data support in oﬄine reinforcement learning, modeling uncertainty through non-
stationarity is costly. Developing a model-free framework is an important aspect of future work. Uncertainty
quantiﬁcation may not be able to compensate for cases of severe data support issues, which may result in biases
in the learned SLTD policy. In this case, better prior knowledge of the dynamics is necessary. SLTD assumes
no hidden/unobserved confounding by relying on an MDP data-generating assumption. Thus our current
uncertainty quantiﬁcation does not account for the added epistemic uncertainty due to potential hidden
confounding. Incorporating clinically motivated sensitivity models to account for unobserved confounding is
an active area of our future work. SLTD can account for some deviations from the expert policy, as well as
the potential for its recommendations to be overridden, though signiﬁcant deviations should be modeled as
an online human-in-the-loop system. In this case, SLTD can serve as a reliable warm-start policy that could
be further improved using (online) human input. We also posit that our current /epsilon1-greedy version will prove
to be more conservative compared to such an online framework, as we expect real human decisions to be
more informed (modulo their own biases) than a noise model that is /epsilon1-greedy. Nonetheless, rigorously testing
this human-in-the-loop learning-to-defer framework is left to future work. Finally, note that if the type of
non-stationarity we would like to defer against is not observed in the oﬄine data, the deferral policy may
over/understimate the need to defer.
Ethical considerations. SLTD is a technical proof-of-concept to defer to an expert by accounting for
long-term eﬀects, assuming that the expert is better at increasing value over the current policy in certain
regions. In practice, an expert policy may not be bias free. Thus, deferral may result in biased decisions if the
expert is biased. Such bias may be exacerbated due to potential sources of hidden confounding (Gottesman
et al., 2018). While we are not focused on addressing bias, exposing uncertainties may encourage expert
introspection. Nonetheless, deferring is better when an automated decision may be harmful.
